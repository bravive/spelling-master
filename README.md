# Spell Master

A daily spelling practice web app for elementary school kids (K–5). Kids memorise words, listen to them spoken aloud, then type the spelling. Progress is rewarded with a Pokémon collection system.

## Features

### User Profiles & Authentication
- Multiple user profiles with avatars, names, and 4-digit PINs
- PINs are **bcrypt-hashed** on the server — never stored in plaintext
- Login is validated server-side; a signed **JWT** (8-hour expiry) is issued on success
- All game-data saves require a valid JWT (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`)
- Rate limiting: max 10 login attempts per IP per 15 minutes
- Admin account (`test` / PIN set via `ADMIN_PIN` env var, default `0000`) can delete non-admin profiles
- Create profile flow: pick a name, choose a starter Pokémon, set a PIN

### Game Flow

**Stage 1 — Remember**
- All 10 words shown simultaneously in a 2-column grid with example sentences
- 3-minute study timer with colour-coded progress bar (green → yellow → red)
- "I'm Ready!" button to advance early; auto-advances at 3:00

**Stage 2 — Listen & Spell**
- Words are hidden; the app picks a random unplayed word and reads it aloud automatically (3×)
- Unlimited replay via button
- On-screen QWERTY keyboard (matches physical keyboard layout) + full physical keyboard support
- 3 attempts per word: correct earns praise, wrong clears the input, third wrong reveals the answer
- Progress tracker shows checkmarks, crosses, current word, and remaining words

### Scoring & Credits
- 10/10 → 5 credits, 9/10 → 3 credits, 8/10 → 2 credits, 7–6/10 → 0 credits
- Score below 6 triggers an automatic retry
- Streak bonus: every 3-day consecutive streak awards +1 bonus credit
- Results screen shows per-word pass/fail, credits earned, and options to retry or pick a new group

### Pokémon Collection
- 10 credits unlock the next Pokémon in Pokédex order
- After every 3 consecutive regular unlocks, a 50% shiny chance activates for the next unlock
- Trophy modal with animated Pokémon reveal, confetti, and voice announcement
- Collection page shows all 60 Pokémon (grey silhouette until caught, purple shimmer for shinies)

### Adaptive Difficulty
- 5 word levels (CVC words up to academic vocabulary)
- Struggling words get higher selection weight; mastered words get lower weight
- Level up automatically when 70% of the current level's words are mastered

### Stats Page
- 30-day streak calendar
- Recent round history (date, score, credits, pass/fail)
- Summary badges: total rounds, mastered words, Pokémon caught
- Mastered word chip list

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required in Production | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `JWT_SECRET` | **Yes** | `dev-secret-do-not-use-in-production` | Secret for signing JWTs — server refuses to start in production without this |
| `ADMIN_PIN` | No | `0000` | PIN for the admin (`test`) account |
| `PORT` | No | `3001` | Port for the Express API server |
| `RAILWAY_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH` | No | `<repo>/data` | Directory for `users.json`; set automatically by Railway when a volume is attached |
| `NODE_ENV` | No | _(unset)_ | Set to `production` to enable static file serving and enforce `JWT_SECRET` |

### Install & Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development (backend on :3001, frontend on :5173 with hot reload)
npm run dev:full   # both together
# or separately:
npm run server     # Express API only
npm run dev        # Vite dev server only (proxies /api to :3001)

# Production (build first, then serve everything from Express on :3001)
npm run build
npm start
```

Open your browser at **http://localhost:5173** (dev) or **http://localhost:3001** (production)

### Other Commands

```bash
npm test         # Run unit tests (Vitest)
npm run build    # Production build (outputs to dist/)
npm run preview  # Preview the production build locally
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

## Project Structure

```
server.js        — Express API (auth, user CRUD, static file serving)
data/
  users.json     — Persistent user storage (gitignored)
src/
  App.jsx        — Main app — all screens, logic, and state
  main.jsx       — React entry point
  data/
    words.js     — Word bank (5 levels, each with word + example sentence)
    pokemon.js   — 60-Pokémon roster with image URL helpers
  __tests__/
    auth.test.js              — Unit tests for PIN hashing, JWT, and auth helpers
    api.test.js               — Integration tests for all REST API endpoints
    wordSelection.test.js     — Unit tests for word selection, stats, and level-up logic
    server.production.test.js — Integration tests for production static-file serving
```

## Deploying to Railway

1. **Connect your repo** — create a new Railway project and link the GitHub repo.

2. **Set environment variables** in the Railway service dashboard → Variables:

   | Variable | Required | Notes |
   |---|---|---|
   | `JWT_SECRET` | **Yes** | Any long random string — server won't start without it |
   | `ADMIN_PIN` | No | Defaults to `0000` |
   | `NODE_ENV` | **Yes** | Set to `production` |

   Railway sets `PORT` and `RAILWAY_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH` automatically — do not override them.

3. **Add a Volume** for data persistence (user profiles survive redeploys):
   - Railway dashboard → your service → Volumes → "New Volume"
   - Set mount path to any absolute path (e.g. `/data`)
   - Railway automatically sets `RAILWAY_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH` to that path; the server uses it for `users.json`

4. **Deploy** — Railway auto-detects the `build` and `start` scripts from `railway.json`:
   - Build: `npm run build` (compiles React to `dist/`)
   - Start: `npm start` (`NODE_ENV=production node server.js` — serves API + static files)

> **Note:** Without a Volume, `data/users.json` is stored on the ephemeral filesystem and will be wiped on every redeploy.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/users` | None | Public profile list (no PINs) |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login` | None (rate limited) | Validate PIN, return JWT |
| `POST` | `/api/users` | None | Create new user profile |
| `PUT` | `/api/users/:id` | JWT (own user or admin) | Save game state |
| `DELETE` | `/api/users/:id` | JWT (admin only) | Delete a profile |
